### Wikimedia MediaWiki JS/CSS ###

#### About ####

These sample JS/CSS userscripts were written by me for Wikimedia Foundation wikis running the MediaWiki framework, and perform a variety of functions.

They exist simply to display my abilities in the use of JavaScript and CSS to perform certain tasks and solve problems. As my abilities have progressed considerably over time, these scripts follow a consistent styleguide including the use of JSDoc for documentation purposes.

The code contained within is correct as of 24/08/17 and may be updated over time.

The complete list, containing links to documentation and the production scripts themselves, may be found at <en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Eizzen>
